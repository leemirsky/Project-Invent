# Project Invent

Project Invent is a national competition in which teams of students work throughout the year to invent a physical technology that will serve a need of a Community Partner. Throughout the year, students gain experience in ***social justice*** (empathetic interviewing, needfinding, etc.), ***engineering*** (concept generation, building with microelectronics, etc.), and ***entrepreneurship*** (evaluating how innovative an idea is, pitching, etc.)

For more information about the national program, see [here](https://projectinvent.org/).
